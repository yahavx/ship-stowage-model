Our travel main directory (that contains some travel sub-directories) that shows our error handling mechanism, is called travels-error-handling.
We have a few travels:
- Travel-No-Errors: a clean run, no errors folder is generated.
- Travel-Diverse-Errors: show many different errors.
- Travel-Diverse-Errors-2: similar to the one before, shows many Plan and Route errors.
- Travel-Not-Enough-Storage: example when the ship becomes full.
- Travel-Bad-Input, Travel-Bad-Input-2: travels that can't be executed.

Note: 2 common errors of cargo_data files weren't addressed in the requirements:
- Container's port destination is the current port
- Container's port destination is not in the route

We decided to assign them numbers 19 and 20, respectively. The algorithm doesn't report that when happen, of course.

What makes our error handling special is that it is very informative and well organized, and allows to debug problems very easily.
Without further explaining, just run our examples and see the results.
