Our travel main directory (that contains some travel sub-directories) that shows our error handling mechanism, is called travels-error-handling.
There is one travel that demonstrates the different kind of errors format and handling:
- Travel-Very-Diverse-Errors

Several other travels in that directory:
- Travel-No-Errors: a clean run, no errors folder is generated.
- Travel-Diverse-Errors: also show many different errors.
- Travel-Not-Enough-Storage: example when the ship becomes full.
- Travel-Bad-Input, Travel-Bad-Input-2: travels that can't be executed.

Note: 2 common errors of cargo_data files weren't addressed in the requirements:
- Container's port destination is the current port
- Container's port destination is not in the route

We decided to assign them numbers 19 and 20, respectively. The algorithm doesn't report that when happen, of course.

What makes our error handling special, is that it is very informative and well organized, and allows to debug problems very easily.

The readme.txt describes how we handle certain things.
Without further explaining, just run our examples and see the results.
